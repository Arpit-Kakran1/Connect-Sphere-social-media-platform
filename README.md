ConnectSphere ðŸ“¸
A full-stack, feature-rich web application inspired by Instagram, built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). This project faithfully replicates Instagramâ€™s core user experience, from its dynamic post feed to its real-time chat functionality using Socket.IO.

âœ¨ Key Features
Authentication & Security: Secure user registration and login system using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and httpOnly cookies for persistent sessions.

User Profiles: Customizable user profiles with profile pictures, bios, follower/following counts, and a grid of the user's posts.

Social Graph: Users can follow and unfollow other users to create a personalized content feed.

Post Management:

Create, view, and delete posts with images and captions.

Engage with posts by liking/unliking and leaving comments.

Dynamic Home Feed: A central feed that displays posts from followed users in chronological order.

Real-Time Chat:

Built with Socket.IO for instant one-on-one messaging.

Tracks and displays the real-time online/offline status of users.

Conversations are stored in the database and fetched on user selection.

Responsive UI: A modern, clean, and fully responsive user interface built with React and styled with Tailwind CSS.
